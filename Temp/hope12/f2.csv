240.3,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,"First, some background on the ODL. For the last two years the Ontario Library Association"
252.9,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,"has acted as a catalyst, bringing together the stakeholders needed to create the Ontario"
265.5,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,"Digital Library (ODL). These stakeholders include Ontario&#x2019;s 5000+ public libraries, university,"

302.8,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,Libraries that serve very different clientele recognize that by working together they can create
315.5,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,"seamless access to quality electronic library services. Through the ODL, students will be"
328.1,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,"able to explore a topic at school, use the same child-safe resources after school (either at"
340.7,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,"home or at a public library), enter college or university with a knowledge of how to use"

390.7,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,We are moving into a period of convergence. With convergence we no longer have to license
403.3,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,commercial products as individual libraries or institutions. We can work together to spend our
415.9,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,money wisely. The provincial government has made this possible by working hard to provide
428.7,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,"all Ontarians with a stable, high-speed communications infrastructure. While there is still a"
441.2,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,"great deal of work needed to improve this infrastructure, libraries are beginning to plan how"
454.0,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,best to exploit communications technology. We can reduce barriers to access and create the

516.5,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,Board. The OJIB strategic plan recommends an electronic library to &#x201c;connect students to new

541.8,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,"that and much more. The ODL will connect students to electronic information, and will also"
554.4,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,leverage this investment to help connect all citizens to the electronic information they need as

592.4,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,Libraries have long been a key delivery point for public services. The ODL will allow that

655.7,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,and of learning from others. The ODL is a very practical solution to various problems.
681.0,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,Jurisdiction-wide digital libraries are very practical and very real. The ODL we propose is
693.6,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,leading edge for Ontario but several jurisdictions have forged the path with collaborative
706.2,90.0,11.0,11.0,False,"digital libraries. We can learn from their experiences. For example, The Alberta Library (TAL)"
